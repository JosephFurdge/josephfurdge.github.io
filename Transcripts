My name is Joseph Furdge Jr. Iâ€™m an incoming freshman at Tougaloo College; at Tougaloo, I plan on studying Biology with an emphasis in Pre-med. and I take pride in myself on hard work. I also possess many skills. However, I enjoy working to get better at these skills everyday. Aside from working, I enjoy sports, philosophy, wildlife studies, writing, and many other things. My personality could be defined as laid-back at times, but talkative at others. Go Seahawks!
